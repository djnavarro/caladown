      <description>The aim of slumdown is to provide a simple Hugo template suitable for R users who want to build a website or start a blog, and is designed to be compatible with both blogdown and hugodown. In this tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to get started. The assumed reader for this tutorial is an R user who has some experience with R Markdown, but is unfamiliar with blogdown, hugodown, or Hugo itself.</description>

      <description>In general I want to use a consistent palette and header across a site, but there are occasions where I might want a single page to use a different style. I don’t want to have to edit with low level settings to do that. In the second part of the tutorial I discuss this kind of customisation.</description>

      <description>The usual advice for deploying a blogdown or hugodown site is to deploy to Netlify rather than GitHub Pages, because there are a few peculiarities to GitHub Pages that can make it difficult. The third part of the tutorial walks you through both versions.</description>
