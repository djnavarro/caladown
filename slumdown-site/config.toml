# e.g. "https://example.com/". If you're planning to deploy on
# GitHub pages the way I've done for the example site at
# https://djnavarro.github.io/hugo-slum/, then you can do something
# like this:
#
#    baseurl = "/hugo-slum/"
#
baseurl = "/"

# Rewrite URLs to be relative to the current content.

# Default is "public", but if you're using GitHub pages you
# need to point this to "docs".

# the Hugo theme that it uses.

# specific files that correspond to all of these pages. See
